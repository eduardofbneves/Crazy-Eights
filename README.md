Simple game to introduce Java classes and Object Oriented Programming inserted in a University course.

The game consists in playing higher than the last player with the exception of the Ace and the 8. The Ace can be played anytime and sets the ranks to 1 and the sequence can be set again. The eight can also be played anytime and clears the play deck. If the hand does not allow to play above, the player must collect all cards on the playing deck and play some card.
