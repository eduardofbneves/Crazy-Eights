# Crazy-Eights modified

This is a card game that consists iin playing higher than than the last card with the exception of the Ace and the 8. The Ace can be played anytime and sets the ranks to 1 so aftewards it can be played any card. The eight can also be played anytime and clears the play deck.
This is a mix of some card games and clearly needs improvement of the rules and some parts of the code.
