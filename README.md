# Crazy-Eights modified

Small game to play with java classes and learn a little about the language.

The game consists in playing higher than the last player with the exception of the Ace and the 8. The Ace can be played anytime and sets the ranks to 1 and the sequence can be set again. The eight can also be played anytime and clears the play deck. If the hand does not allow to play above, the player must collect all cards on the playing deck and play some card.

This is a mix of some card games and clearly needs improvement of the rules and some parts of the code.
